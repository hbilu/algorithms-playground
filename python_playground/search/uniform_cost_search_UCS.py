# Perform Uniform Cost Search (UCS) on a weighted graph (adjacency list) to find
# the least-cost path from a start node to a goal node. UCS uses a priority queue
# to always expand the node with the lowest cumulative cost first.

# Assumes the graph is positively weighted (no negative edge weights).
# Returns (path, cost) if the goal is reachable; otherwise (None, -1).

# Time Complexity: O(b^d)
# - b: branching factor
# - d: depth of the optimal solution (in terms of number of edges, not cost)

# Space Complexity: O(b^d)
# - Due to storing all frontier paths in the priority queue

# Example:
# graph = {
#     'A': [('B', 1), ('C', 5)],
#     'B': [('D', 2)],
#     'C': [('D', 2)],
#     'D': []
# }
# uniform_cost_search(graph, 'A', 'D') â†’ (['A', 'B', 'D'], 3)
