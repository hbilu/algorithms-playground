# Given a connected undirected graph containing V vertices represented by a 2-d adjacency list adj[][], 
# where each adj[i] represents the list of vertices connected to vertex i. 
# Perform a Depth First Search (DFS) traversal starting from vertex 0, 
# visiting vertices from left to right as per the given adjacency list, 
#Â and return a list containing the DFS traversal of the graph.

# Time Complexity: O(V + E)
# - V: number of vertices
# - E: number of edges
# - Each vertex and edge is visited once in DFS traversal.

# Space Complexity: O(V)
# - visited[] and result[] take O(V) space
# - recursion call stack may go as deep as O(V) in the worst case
